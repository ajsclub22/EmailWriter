🔄 How It Works
A client sends a JSON request to the /api/mail/generate endpoint with:

The original email message (emailContent)

The desired tone (tone), e.g., formal, casual, etc.

The EmailController handles the request and delegates it to EmailGeneratorService.

The service builds a prompt dynamically, incorporating:

The email content

The tone

Specific instructions to return only a reply with no subject or metadata

The prompt is sent to Gemini API via a non-blocking WebClient request.

Gemini responds with a generated reply.

The app extracts just the email text from Gemini’s response and returns it to the client.

🧰 Troubleshooting & Logs
Make sure your Gemini API key is valid and active.

If there's an issue parsing the response, check logs for Failed to extract response from Gemini API.

For better error tracking, SLF4J is used for logging.

📌 Notes
The response is only the reply content — no email headers, subjects, or explanations.

Prompt formatting ensures Gemini returns a clean, usable reply.

You can enhance this project to support:

Multilingual replies

Emotion/tone switching

Integration with email services (Gmail API, Outlook, etc.)
